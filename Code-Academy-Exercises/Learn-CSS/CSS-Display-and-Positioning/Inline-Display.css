/* This lesson involved changing the HTML code to highlight inline functionality.
We learned that some elements have the default display as "inline".
Inline elements have a tight box rendered around them and allow content to be placed in the same line as other elements.
In CSS we can change the behavior of elements to make them inline:
h1 {
  display: inline;
}
This will cause the browser to render h1 elements as inline and will share the same line as other inline elements that are either before or after the h1 element.
