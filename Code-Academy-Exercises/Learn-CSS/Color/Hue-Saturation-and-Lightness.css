/*
This section taught about the Hue Saturation and Brightness color scheme.
The Hue is actually selected from the color wheel where the angle of the hue corrosponds to a different color. It is a number between 0-360

Saturation is the intensity or purity of the color. On the color wheel, we use a percentage to select the distance from the center of the wheel to select our intensity (or saturation).

Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Picked as a percentage, 50% is normal lightness. A number closer to 100% will produce a whiter color, while values closer to 0% produce colors closer to black.

HSL is convienient for making small adjustments to colors without adjusting it through RGB. It will allow us to have colors of a similar saturation and lightness, but different hues.
Example:
body {
  background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 80%);
}
