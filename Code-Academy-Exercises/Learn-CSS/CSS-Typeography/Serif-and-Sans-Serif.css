/*
In this lesson we learned the difference between Serif and Sans Serif fonts.
Serif — fonts that have extra details on the ends of each letter. Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.
Sans-Serif — fonts that do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. Instead, letters have straight, flat edges, like Arial or Helvetica.

Serif fonts are prefered in print and are considered easier to read over long paragraphs of text.
