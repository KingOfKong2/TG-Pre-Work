/* We learned about concise body arrow functions. This can help us to streamline our function to be as small as possible.
We learned that 0 and 2 or more input parameters require the parentheses, while 1 input does not require them
We learned that if a function block only cntains one line of code we do not need the curly braces or return. (implicit return)
We can combine this knowledge with the ternary operator to create one line if/else statements and return.
