/*
In this lesson we learned how to declare functions using the function keyword. The identifier (or name) comes after the function keyword. Then the function body is enclosed between curly brackets.
Each time a function is called, all of the code in the function body is executed.
Example:
function nameHere(input variables){
	//code to be executed;
}
It is also mentioned that functions should be declared before they are called. JS is a little fuzzy in that it allows you to call functions that arent declared yet. But this may not work for other languages.
