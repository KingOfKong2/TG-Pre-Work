/*
We learned that we can pass arguments into functions. When declaring the function we must define the parameters that it is expecting.
Inside the code block we can then use the passed argument as a normal variable.
Example:
function addTwo(num,num2){
	console.log(`The sum of ${num} and ${num2} is: `+num+num2);
}
