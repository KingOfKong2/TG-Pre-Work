/* In this lesson we learned about nested arrays.
A nested array is an array inside of an array, or a list of lists.
When we want to target a specific element of list of lists we must chain array selectors ([]).
Example:
let numberClusters=[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]];
const target=numberClusters[2][1];
const target will target the second array element of numberCluster. Once we have that, target the first array index from the Sub list that is returned.
