/*
This lesson introduced the idea of arrays as a data structure.
Arrays are very useful for keeping lists of data that are accessable by index.
A simple array might look like this:
let fruits=['Banana','Apple','Orange'];
This is the same as saying:
Hey JS, make a list for me, I want it to include 'Banana', 'Apple', and 'Orange' and save it to the variable called fruits;
