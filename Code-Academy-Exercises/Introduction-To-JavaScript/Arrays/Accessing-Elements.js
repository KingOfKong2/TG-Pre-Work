/* This lesson taught about accessing array elements.
Array elements can be targeted by using the brackets and an integer (for the space in the array).
Arrays are numbered from 0->end-1 so array item 1 is actually array[0], 2 is array[1] etc...
If we try to access an array element past the end of the array we will be returned with an undefined value.
