/* This lesson was very important and taught how to use loops to traverse arrays.
Using a normal for loop expression, we set the end condition to arrayName.length
Doing this will allow your for iterator to move through the array with each call.
The array.length will return the number of elements in the array and because of zero index array numbering we must use use > or < and not >= or <=.
