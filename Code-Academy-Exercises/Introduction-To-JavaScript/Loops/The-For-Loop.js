// Write your code below
for(let iter=5;iter<=10;iter++){
  console.log(iter);
}
/*
This lesson taught the basic syntax for a for loop.
Each for loop has 3 parts that are seperated by semicolons:

an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.

a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.

an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.
Example:
for(let iter=5;iter<=10;iter++){
  console.log(iter);
}
iter is declared as 5, loop until iter is <=10, on each iteration increment iter by 1.
