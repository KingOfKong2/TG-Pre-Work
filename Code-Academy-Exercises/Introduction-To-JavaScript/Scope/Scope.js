/* This intro lesson introduced the idea of scope.
Scope is normally used to restrict access to helper functions to specific classes or namespaces.
Variables that are declared inside of functions will typically be erased (or not accessable) outside of the function.
THis allows our browser/computer to safely free up data that will not be used outside of a function.
