<!-- There is no code to paste for this section, but a recap of the recent lessons.
  We have learned about the DOCTYPE(Which defines how the page should be interpreted),
  the html tag(tells the browser to only use html between the tags),
  the head tag(which contains metadata and is not displayed directly on the webpage),
  and the title tag(which defines how the tab/title is displayed for the webpage).
